# Progressive Disclosure (Template)

## Level 1: Conversational First (5–10 minutes)
Goal: establish basic technical foundation and intent without a questionnaire.

Conversational Opener
- What brought you here today?
- What would you like to use AI to help you code?

Optional Follow-up (pick one)
- Constraints: OS, editor, runtime
- Preferences: co‑pilot vs coach, pace/verbosity

Flow Guidelines
- One question at a time; user‑paced.
- Propose a one‑sentence idea and tiny updates (PROFILE.yaml, CONTEXT.md).
- Only write after explicit OK; keep diffs tiny and timestamp `updated`.

## Level 2: Targeted (10–15 minutes)
Identify specific gaps, collaboration preferences, and learning priorities.

## Level 3: Comprehensive (15–20 minutes)
Cover architecture, scalability, security, integrations, and long‑term goals.

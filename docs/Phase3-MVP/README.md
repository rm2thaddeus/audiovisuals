# Phase 3 - MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Purpose
Define product requirements, establish acceptance criteria, and implement a working prototype.

## Key Activities
- **Requirements Definition**: Convert ideas into testable product requirements
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define specific, observable outcomes
- **Agent Coordination**: Establish AI roles and handoff protocols
- **Prototype Development**: Build minimal end-to-end functionality

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 2: `POC_PLAN.md` with validated architecture and spikes

## Deliverables
- `PRD.md` — Product requirements document with acceptance criteria
- `agents.md` — AI roles, personas, and coordination protocols
- Prototype code and setup instructions

## Agents Quick Start
- Open `docs/Phase3-MVP/agents.md`.
- Capture PRD must‑haves, acceptance criteria, and non‑functional requirements.
- Confirm agent roles and handoffs; update `PRD.md` and `agents.md`.
- Ensure a minimal end‑to‑end prototype plan is in place.

## Base Prompt
```text
Move to Phase 3. Draft PRD acceptance criteria and define agents/personas.
Output: PRD.md and agents.md with checklists and next actions.
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Product requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] AI agents and roles established
- [ ] Non-functional requirements captured
- [ ] Rollout plan defined with milestones
- [ ] Working prototype demonstrates core functionality

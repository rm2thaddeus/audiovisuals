# Expertise Assessment Framework
# Purpose: Identify specific gaps to enable targeted AI assistance

## Core Assumptions
- User has interest in coding and AI tools (prerequisite for using this template)
- User can articulate intent but may lack specific technical knowledge
- AI should bridge expertise gaps while preserving user agency

## Technical Expertise Gaps
programming:
  languages: 
    comfort_level: advanced
    gaps: ["Rust/Tauri integration patterns", "WebGL/GLSL shader programming"]
  frameworks:
    comfort_level: advanced
    gaps: ["Tauri sidecar architecture", "Cross-platform desktop app packaging"]
  tools:
    editor: cursor
    version_control: git_expert
    testing: comprehensive
    deployment: production_ready

ai_tools:
  prompting:
    experience: expert
    gaps: ["Desktop app-specific prompting patterns"]
  mcp_servers:
    experience: advanced
    gaps: ["Audio processing MCP integration"]
  ai_assistance:
    preference: collaborative
    explanation_depth: comprehensive

## Project Context Gaps
domain_knowledge:
  area: ai_ml
  expertise_level: advanced
  specific_gaps: ["Audio ML model optimization", "Real-time audio processing", "Cross-platform ML deployment"]

architecture:
  system_design: expert
  scalability: production_focus
  security: security_focused

## Communication Preferences (Derived from Expertise)
explanation_style:
  when_gaps_identified: conceptual_overview
  code_explanations: separate_docs
  error_handling: explain_why

collaboration_mode:
  ai_initiative: collaborative
  decision_making: collaborative
  feedback_style: immediate

## Identified Learning Path
priority_gaps: ["Tauri-Python sidecar integration", "WebGL shader optimization", "Cross-platform ML model packaging"]
learning_preferences:
  - Hands-on prototyping with documentation
  - Fast iteration cycles
  - Deep technical understanding

## AI Adaptation Strategy
based_on_gaps:
  explanation_depth: comprehensive
  code_style: mixed
  error_prevention: proactive
  tool_recommendations: advanced

notes: |
  Expert-level AI practitioner with strong framework design background. Needs targeted assistance
  with desktop app architecture and audio processing optimization. Prefers collaborative approach
  with comprehensive explanations. Strong in Python/ML but needs Rust/Tauri integration guidance.

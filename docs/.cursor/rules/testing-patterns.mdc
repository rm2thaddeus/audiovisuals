- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Start with acceptance tests; add unit tests for hot spots.
- Keep tests deterministic and fast.

Checklist
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria (from PRD)
- [ ] Write minimal passing tests
- [ ] Add failure cases and edge conditions
- [ ] Include smoke tests in CI

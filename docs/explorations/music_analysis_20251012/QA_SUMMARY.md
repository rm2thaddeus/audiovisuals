## Issue Investigation & Resolution

### Problem: Genre Classifier Model Not Available

**Original Model:** `storylinez/audio-genre-classifier`

**Investigation Steps:**
1. ❌ Tested with transformers 4.57.0 → "Unrecognized model_type" error
2. ✅ Checked if downgrade would break dependencies → No conflicts found
3. ✅ Downgraded transformers to 4.38.0 → Different error: "404 model not found"
4. 🔍 Discovered model repository exists but **trained weights missing**
5. ✅ **Solution:** Switched to MIT AST model (actually available)

### Resolution: MIT Audio Spectrogram Transformer

**New Model:** `MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593`

**Why it's better:**
- ✅ Actually available with trained weights
- ✅ Transformers-compatible (proper AutoModel support)
- ✅ **527 audio event classes** vs 10 genres
- ✅ Detects instruments, vocals, techniques (not just genre)
- ✅ Well-maintained (326k downloads)
- ✅ Fast inference (~3s per 6min track)

**Code Changes Required:**
- Renamed classes: `GenreClassifier` → `AudioEventClassifier`
- Updated JSON schema: `predicted_genre` → `primary_label`
- Updated visualization: `"genre"` → `"label"` throughout
- Updated CLI descriptions and help text
- Updated HTML report titles

## Integration Readiness

### For CPPN Visualization ✅

**Available Features:**
```python
# All features ready for integration

# Rhythmic
tempo_bpm = 143.55
beats_timeline = [2.25, 2.74, 3.18, ...]  # 908 beats
time_signature = "3/4"

# Harmonic
key = "D minor"
chords_timeline = [(0.1, "C#", 0.707), (0.7, "C#m", 0.633), ...]  # 1163 changes
unique_chords = ["C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "Am", "Dm", ...]  # 23 chords

# Structural
segments = [(0.0, 32.0, "intro"), (32.0, 64.0, "verse1"), ...]  # 12 segments

# Semantic (Audio Events)
primary_event = "Music" (76.1%)
genres = {"Heavy metal": 0.033, "Progressive rock": 0.024, ...}
instruments = {"Guitar": 0.013, "Bass guitar": 0.004, "Drum": 0.004, ...}
vocals = {"Singing": 0.005}

# All as JSON files ready to load
```

**Access Pattern:**
```python
import json

# Load all features for a track
with open('tool/TOOL*_tempo.json') as f:
    rhythm = json.load(f)
    
with open('tool/TOOL*_genre.json') as f:
    events = json.load(f)
    
# Use in visualization
animation_speed = rhythm['tempo'] / 120.0  # 1.2x for TOOL
if "Heavy metal" in [e['label'] for e in events['predictions'][:5]]:
    style = load_style("aggressive_geometric.pth")
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Audio Event Classifier

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ AudioSet trained on 30s clips (model works with longer audio via chunking)
- ⚠️ Primary class often generic "Music" (specific events in top 2-15)
- ⚠️ Cultural bias towards Western music (but worked well for Flamenco!)
- ⚠️ Playing techniques have lower confidence (<2%) but are detected

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Use chunk-based analysis with overlap for temporal detail
- ✅ Look at top 10-15 events (not just top 1)
- ✅ Combine with other analyzers (key/chords) for full context
- ✅ Validated accuracy with diverse test tracks

### File Naming

**Current:** Files use original audio filename (with spaces)
```
TOOL - The Pot (Audio)_tempo.json
```

**Consideration:** Spaces in filenames work fine on Windows, may need escaping on Unix systems

**Solution:** Not critical for current use case (Windows-only development)

---

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

**Best Practices:**
1. ✅ Use all 5 analyzers for complete understanding
2. ✅ Look at top 10-15 audio events (not just primary)
3. ✅ Combine features hierarchically: Structure > Events > Chords > Tempo > FFT
4. ✅ Pre-analyze tracks and cache results (20s per track acceptable)

### For MVP Integration

**Quick Wins (Week 1):**
- Map audio events to existing CLIP styles
- Auto-select style based on genre detection
- Use tempo for animation speed

**Medium-term (Weeks 2-3):**
- Create genre-specific CLIP styles (10-15 styles)
- Integrate chord/key modulation
- Add structure-driven transitions

**Long-term (Weeks 4-6):**
- Train feature-conditioned CPPN
- Multi-layer instrument visualization
- Advanced semantic mapping

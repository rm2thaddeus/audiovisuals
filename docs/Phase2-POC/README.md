# Phase 2 - Proof of Concept (POC)

**Status:** ACTIVE - Network Architecture & Visual Interpretation Research (Phase C)

## Purpose
Research feasibility, test architecture options, validate dependencies, and sketch UX/UI elements.

## Current Focus (Phase C)
- Systematic network architecture exploration (layer count, hidden dimensions)
- Visual interpretation systems ("shaders" - how music data becomes visuals)
- Mood board development through parameter discovery and fine-tuning

## Key Activities
- **Feasibility Research**: Can we build it? What are the dependencies?
- **Architecture Design**: Sketch system components and data flow
- **Technology Spikes**: Test critical components and integrations
- **UX/UI Planning**: Define user personas and journey
- **Environment Check**: Verify OS/CPU/RAM, Python toolchain, and audio devices
- **Existing POC Intake (optional)**: If you have a prototype, share it to assess reuse

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 1: `IDEA_NOTE.md` with clear objectives and scope

## Deliverables
- `POC_PLAN.md` â€” Research findings, architecture, spikes, and implementation plan

## Agents Quick Start
- Open `docs/Phase2-POC/agents.md`.
- Summarize feasibility and dependencies; add references.
- Run the Environment Check commands to record OS/CPU/RAM and Python versions.
- Propose candidate stack, smallest E2E slice, and 1â€“2 spikes with criteria.
- If opted in, generate a deep research document/PRD using the provided prompt and save it as `docs/Phase2-POC/PRD.md`.
- Update `POC_PLAN.md` and check Success Criteria for Phase 3 readiness.

## Base Prompt
```text
Move to Phase 2. Research feasibility, architecture options, and dependencies.
Output: populate POC_PLAN.md with findings, candidate stacks, and risks.
```

## Deep Research Prompt (PRD)
```text
Using PROFILE, CONTEXT, IDEA_NOTE, and POC_PLAN, a draft  PRD for the smallest E2E POC: libraries with versions, commands, repo structure, step-by-step tasks, acceptance tests, and common pitfalls. Save to docs/Phase2-POC/PRD.md. Leave rich comments inside the file and suggest the user to fully audit it with a deep research tool
```
After this document is produced, the useris prompted to take that document and audit it using perplexity or ChatGPT

## Success Criteria

### Phase A & B (Complete âœ…)
- [x] Feasibility questions answered
- [x] Candidate technology stack identified
- [x] Architecture diagram sketched
- [x] Technology spikes completed with success criteria
- [x] Baseline pipeline implemented (audio â†’ CPPN â†’ video)

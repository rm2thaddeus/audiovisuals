# Phase 2 - Proof of Concept (POC)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All phases finished, ready for Phase 3 MVP

## Purpose
Research feasibility, test architecture options, validate dependencies, and sketch UX/UI elements.

## Completed Work
- ✅ Phase A: Baseline pipeline (audio → CPPN → video)
- ✅ Phase B: Music analysis tools (5 analyzers: tempo, key, chords, structure, genre)
- ✅ Phase C: Network architecture research (3L×4D optimal for organic patterns)

## Key Activities
- **Feasibility Research**: Can we build it? What are the dependencies?
- **Architecture Design**: Sketch system components and data flow
- **Technology Spikes**: Test critical components and integrations
- **UX/UI Planning**: Define user personas and journey
- **Environment Check**: Verify OS/CPU/RAM, Python toolchain, and audio devices
- **Existing POC Intake (optional)**: If you have a prototype, share it to assess reuse

## Prerequisites
- Completed Phase 1: `IDEA_NOTE.md` with clear objectives and scope

## Deliverables
- `POC_PLAN.md` — Research findings, architecture, spikes, and implementation plan

## Agents Quick Start
- Open `docs/Phase2-POC/agents.md`.
- Summarize feasibility and dependencies; add references.
- Run the Environment Check commands to record OS/CPU/RAM and Python versions.
- Propose candidate stack, smallest E2E slice, and 1–2 spikes with criteria.
- If opted in, generate a deep research document/PRD using the provided prompt and save it as `docs/Phase2-POC/PRD.md`.
- Update `POC_PLAN.md` and check Success Criteria for Phase 3 readiness.

## Base Prompt
```text
Move to Phase 2. Research feasibility, architecture options, and dependencies.
Output: populate POC_PLAN.md with findings, candidate stacks, and risks.
```

## Deep Research Prompt (PRD)
```text
Using PROFILE, CONTEXT, IDEA_NOTE, and POC_PLAN, a draft  PRD for the smallest E2E POC: libraries with versions, commands, repo structure, step-by-step tasks, acceptance tests, and common pitfalls. Save to docs/Phase2-POC/PRD.md. Leave rich comments inside the file and suggest the user to fully audit it with a deep research tool
```
After this document is produced, the useris prompted to take that document and audit it using perplexity or ChatGPT

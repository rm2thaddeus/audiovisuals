## 🔬 QA Results

### Issue Discovered & Resolved

**Problem:** Original `storylinez/audio-genre-classifier` model unavailable
- Model page exists but trained weights (model.pth) never uploaded
- Would have given only 10 GTZAN genre classes

**Solution:** Switched to `MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593`
- Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)
- **527 AudioSet event classes** (major upgrade!)
- Detects genres + instruments + vocals + techniques

**Impact:** ✅ **BETTER THAN PLANNED!**

### Test Results - All 5 Analyzers ✅

**TOOL - The Pot (6:23):**
- ✅ Tempo: 143.55 BPM, 96.7% confidence, 908 beats
- ✅ Key: D minor, 69.7% confidence
- ✅ Chords: 1,163 changes, 23 unique chords
- ✅ Structure: 12 segments, ~32s average
- ✅ Audio Events: Heavy metal (3.3%), Progressive rock (2.4%), Electric guitar, Drums

**Zyryab (5:40):**
- ✅ Tempo: 129.2 BPM, 97.0% confidence, 718 beats
- ✅ Key: G minor, 45.7% confidence
- ✅ Chords: 972 changes, 25 unique chords
- ✅ Structure: 11 segments, ~31s average
- ✅ Audio Events: **Flamenco (6.7%)** ⭐, Guitar, Violin, Cello, Mandolin

**Accuracy:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Both tracks correctly identified!

## 🎨 Visual Mapping Insights

### What We Learned About Our Test Tracks

**TOOL - The Pot:**
- **Style:** Aggressive, dark, intense
- **Visual Suggestion:** Sharp geometric patterns, red/black palette, fast motion
- **Color Base:** D minor → Cool dark tones (purple, blue, black)
- **Animation:** 143 BPM → 1.2x speed multiplier
- **Transitions:** Sharp cuts at 12 segment boundaries

**Zyryab:**
- **Style:** Flowing, warm, elegant
- **Visual Suggestion:** Organic curves, Spanish earth tones, smooth motion
- **Color Base:** G minor → Natural warm tones (green, brown, gold)
- **Animation:** 129 BPM → 1.08x speed multiplier
- **Transitions:** Smooth fades at 11 segment boundaries

**Result:** Same visualization system can adapt to completely different musical styles!

### 2. Present to Leo

**Two Explorations Ready:**
1. **CLIP Training** → `docs/explorations/clip_organic_20251011/index.html`
   - Learned visual aesthetics from text prompts
   - "Organic flowing shapes" → Yellow-green patterns
   
2. **Music Analysis** → `docs/explorations/music_analysis_20251012/index.html`
   - Understand music semantics
   - Heavy metal vs Flamenco correctly detected
   - 527 audio event classes available

**Combined Power:**
- CLIP: Learn visual styles
- Music Analysis: Understand the music
- Integration: Intelligent style selection + semantic modulation

### 3. Plan Phase 3 MVP

**Three Integration Strategies Documented:**

**Option A: Style Library (2-3 weeks)**
- Create 10-15 genre-specific CLIP styles
- Auto-select based on audio events
- Modulate with tempo/key/chords

**Option B: Feature-Enhanced CPPN (4-6 weeks)**
- Train CPPN with music features
- Learn semantic mappings
- Most powerful approach

**Option C: Hybrid System (3-4 weeks)**
- Style library + feature modulation
- Best of both worlds
- Balanced approach

# Genre Classifier Status - Phase B

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Model not available  

---

## Problem Summary

The genre classifier implementation is complete and follows all patterns from other analyzers, but the specified pre-trained model is unavailable.

### Model Availability Issue

**Attempted Model:** `storylinez/audio-genre-classifier`

**Error After Downgrade (transformers 4.38.0):**
```
OSError: storylinez/audio-genre-classifier does not appear to have a file named config.json.
Checkout 'https://huggingface.co/storylinez/audio-genre-classifier/main' for available files.
```

**Diagnosis:** The model repository does not exist or was removed from HuggingFace.

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Code Structure** - Complete and tested
- `analyzers/genre_classifier.py` (249 lines)
- `cli/analyze_genre.py` (234 lines)
- `visualization/plot_genre.py` (169 lines)
- HTML generation support added to `html_generator.py`

✅ **Code Quality**
- Follows same patterns as tempo/key/chords/structure analyzers
- Proper error handling, logging, type hints
- CLI interface matches other analyzers
- Visualization functions implemented

✅ **Documentation**
- `GENRE_CLASSIFIER_RESEARCH.md` created
- Requirements updated
- POC_PLAN.md updated (lists 5 analyzers)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Alternative Model (Recommended)

**Suitable alternatives:**

1. **MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593** (Audio Spectrogram Transformer)
   - Model ID: `MIT/ast-finetuned-audioset-10-10-0.4593`
   - Purpose: Audio event classification (can be adapted)
   - Status: Available on HuggingFace
   - Note: Not trained for music genre specifically

2. **facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h** (can be fine-tuned)
   - Requires fine-tuning on GTZAN dataset
   - Timeline: 1-2 days training

3. **Custom LibROSA-based heuristic classifier**
   - Use tempo, key, chords, structure features
   - Rule-based genre estimation
   - Fast, no model download required
   - Accuracy: ~50-60% (estimated)

### Option 2: Train Custom Model

**Approach:**
- Use GTZAN dataset (freely available)
- Train simple CNN on mel spectrograms
- 2-4 hours training on RTX 5070
- Timeline: 1 day (download data + train + integrate)

### Option 3: Mark as Future Work

**Approach:**
- Update documentation to reflect "4 working analyzers"
- Note genre classifier as "Phase B+ future enhancement"
- Complete all other deliverables

---

## Recommendation

**For immediate completion:**
→ **Option 3**: Document current state, proceed with 4 working analyzers

**Reasoning:**
1. All other Phase B goals achieved (4/4 core analyzers working)
2. Genre classification is "nice-to-have" not critical
3. Can be added later without affecting MVP integration
4. User indicated another chat had it working - may have different model or version

**For future enhancement:**
→ **Option 1.3**: Implement LibROSA heuristic genre estimator
- No external dependencies
- Fast implementation (~2-3 hours)
- Reasonable accuracy for MVP testing
- Can be replaced with ML model later

## Current Analyzer Status

| Analyzer | Status | Performance | Output Formats |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tempo    | ✅ Working | 3.8s (6min audio) | JSON + PNG + HTML |
| Key      | ✅ Working | 4.0s (6min audio) | JSON + PNG + HTML |
| Chords   | ✅ Working | 10.2s (6min audio) | JSON + PNG + HTML |
| Structure| ✅ Working | 1.7s (6min audio) | JSON + PNG + HTML |
| Genre    | ⚠️ Blocked | N/A | Code ready, no model |

**Total Implemented:** 4/5 analyzers (80% complete)  
**Total Code:** 5,150+ lines (including genre classifier code)  
**Critical Path:** Not blocked - can proceed to Phase 3 with 4 analyzers

---

## Next Actions

1. **Document current state** (this file)
2. **Update POC_PLAN.md** to reflect 4 working analyzers + 1 pending
3. **Create exploration results** with 4 analyzer outputs
4. **Update presentation docs** with Phase B achievements
5. **Note genre as future enhancement**

**Decision needed:** Should we proceed with 4 analyzers now, or spend time finding/implementing alternative genre classifier?

## Files Affected

**Created/Modified:**
- `analyzers/genre_classifier.py` (ready, needs model fix)
- `cli/analyze_genre.py` (ready, needs model fix)
- `visualization/plot_genre.py` (ready)
- `html_generator.py` (genre support added)
- `GENRE_CLASSIFIER_RESEARCH.md` (created)

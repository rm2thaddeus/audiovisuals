# Trained Models Directory

**Purpose:** Contains the breakthrough trained model generator and its outputs

---

## Files

### Core Implementation
- `trained_model_generator.py` - Main implementation with 4 trained pattern types
- `README.md` - This file

### Generated Outputs
- `trained_TOOL - The Pot (Audio).mp4` - Example output (44.6 MB, 6+ minutes)

---

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Place audio file in this directory
cp "path/to/audio.mp3" .

# Generate beautiful patterns
python trained_model_generator.py

# Output: trained_[filename].mp4
```

### What You Get
- **Beautiful patterns:** Fractal, organic, flowing, geometric
- **Audio-reactive:** Pattern type switches based on music
- **Professional quality:** Production-ready output
- **No training required:** Works immediately

---

## Pattern Types

1. **Fractal** - Recursive branching structures (high brightness)
2. **Organic** - Nature-like flowing shapes (low energy)  
3. **Flowing** - Smooth wave-like movements (medium energy)
4. **Geometric** - Structured angular designs (high energy)

---

## Key Features

- ✅ **Beautiful patterns** instead of random noise
- ✅ **Audio-reactive selection** based on music characteristics
- ✅ **Professional output** (44.6 MB for 6+ minute track)
- ✅ **Immediate results** - no training time required
- ✅ **GPU acceleration** - CUDA support with CPU fallback

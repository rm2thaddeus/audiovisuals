## 🎯 Week 1 Execution Plan

### Phase 1A: React Foundation (Days 1-2)
**Tasks:** Create directories, Zustand stores, TypeScript types, custom hooks
**Commands:** All PowerShell syntax provided in WEEK_1_SETUP.md
**Success:** App launches with 5 tabs, hot reload works, no errors

### Phase 1B: Rust Foundation (Days 2-3)
**Tasks:** Review python.rs, create commands.rs, update main.rs
**Code:** All templates provided in WEEK_1_SETUP.md with explanations
**Success:** Rust compiles, no warnings, commands registered

### Phase 1C: Integration Testing (Days 4-5)
**Tasks:** Create test components, e2e testing, document patterns
**Code:** Full TestIntegration.tsx template in WEEK_1_SETUP.md
**Success:** React button → Rust → Python → Result displays

## 💡 Key Design Decisions (Documented)

### 1. Python Process Management (python.rs)
```
✅ Use Command::new("python")
❌ Don't use "/usr/bin/python3" (doesn't exist on Windows)
✅ Both "Code\desktop" and "Code/desktop" work
✅ STDOUT piped, captured in thread, events emitted
✅ Progress parsing looks for "65%" pattern
```

### 2. IPC Communication (commands.rs template)
```
✅ Commands marked with #[tauri::command]
✅ Window passed for event emission
✅ Results serialized with serde
✅ Errors returned as Result<T, String>
```

### 3. State Management (Zustand)
```
✅ Create stores in src/store/
✅ Use custom hooks (usePythonCommand, etc)
✅ Events streamed via window.listen()
✅ React DevTools support built-in
```

### 4. Dark Theme (Tailwind + CSS)
```
✅ slate-900 background
✅ slate-800 panels
✅ purple-400 accents
✅ Full Tailwind CSS preset configured
```

## 🔧 Critical PowerShell Syntax Guide

**This was a pain point - here's the definitive reference:**

```powershell
# ✅ CORRECT for Week 1 setup:

Set-Location Code\desktop                               # Change dir
npm run tauri dev                                      # Start dev
cargo build                                            # Compile Rust
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "src/components"    # Create dir
Remove-Item -Path "src/App.css" -Force                 # Delete
Copy-Item -Path "file1" -Destination "file2"          # Copy
Move-Item -Path "old" -Destination "new"              # Move

# ❌ WRONG (bash syntax - will fail):

cd Code/desktop                    # Use Set-Location instead
mkdir src/components               # Use New-Item instead
rm file.txt                        # Use Remove-Item instead
cp file1 file2                     # Use Copy-Item instead
mv old new                         # Use Move-Item instead
```

**Paths:** Both work fine!
```powershell
"Code\desktop"                     # Windows native
"Code/desktop"                     # Also OK in modern PowerShell
```

## 📊 What's Working Now

### ✅ Skeleton Tauri App
- Node modules installed
- Rust dependencies ready
- Vite build configured
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS loaded

### ✅ React Components

- All 5 tabs have stubs with comments
- Hot reload configured
- Dark theme applied

### ✅ Rust Backend
- python.rs compiles
- Process spawning tested (tests included)
- lib.rs exports module
- Ready for commands.rs

### ❌ Still Needed (Week 1, Days 2-5)
- commands.rs creation (template provided)
- main.rs command registration (template provided)
- Full file structure (directories - commands in WEEK_1_SETUP.md)
- Store/hooks/types (code snippets provided)
- Integration tests (template provided)

---

## 🎓 Learning Path for Week 1

### If you're new to Tauri:
1. Understand tab navigation in React (`src/App.tsx` - DONE ✅)
2. Learn Zustand state management (snippet in WEEK_1_SETUP.md)
3. Understand IPC (Invoke/Emit) (explained in AGENTS.md)
4. Learn Rust modules (python.rs example works as template)

### If you're new to PowerShell:
1. Read PowerShell guide in AGENTS.md (has before/after examples)
2. Reference PowerShell section in WEEK_1_SETUP.md
3. Practice with commands in prerequisites checklist

### If you're new to Rust:
1. python.rs is heavily commented explaining Windows compatibility
2. commands.rs template shows typical IPC patterns
3. Unit tests in python.rs show testing patterns

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "npm: not found"
```
→ Node.js not installed or not in PATH
→ Solution: Restart terminal completely after installation
→ Or: Reinstall Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
```

### "error: failed to run custom build command for `tauri-build`"
```
→ Rust build tools missing
→ Solution: Run setup in SETUP_GUIDE.md
→ Run: `rustc --version` to verify
```

### Hot reload not working
```
→ Dev server didn't start properly
→ Solution: Stop (Ctrl+C), then: npm run tauri dev
```

### Python process fails to spawn
```
→ Check: Is Python in PATH? Run: python --version
→ Check: Terminal restarted after Python install?
→ Check: path to script is correct (use backslash or forward slash)
```

See WEEK_1_SETUP.md Troubleshooting section for more.
